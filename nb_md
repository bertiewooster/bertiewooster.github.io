# Note: Before running this script,
#  1) If you downloaded the notebook from Google Colab, replace file name underscores with hyphens
#  2) If you want to embed an image in the notebook rather than importing it from an external file,
#     a) Set up Markdown cell with <img src="" />
#     b) Convert image to Base64 at https://www.base64-image.de/ (can be JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG or BMP, up to 1MB)
#     c) Paste the output (starting with data:image/) into the quotes in the img tag
#  3) Change the name of the notebook (input) and markdown (output) files in the non-commented code below
#  4) Save this script
#  5) Use venv in this folder, not conda, in terminal using 
#        . venv/bin/activate

# Run this script in the terminal using ./nb_md

jupyter nbconvert _notebooks/2023-03-10-Revisiting-a-Classic-Cheminformatics-Paper-The-Wiener-Index.ipynb --to markdown --output 2023-03-10-Revisiting-a-Classic-Cheminformatics-Paper-The-Wiener-Index.md

# Note: After running this script, to post a blog post:
#  1) Move the markdown file into the _posts folder
#  2) Move the _files folder (containing the images) into the images folder
#  3) Fix the image links in the markdown file by converting e.g.
#          ![png](2022-11-11-RDKit-Recap-decomposition-tree_files/2022-11-11-RDKit-Recap-decomposition-tree_10_0.png)
#      to
#         ![png](/images/2022-11-11-RDKit-Recap-decomposition-tree_files/2022-10-09-RDKit-find-and-highlight-the-maximum-common-substructure-between-molecules_24_0.png)
#      by replacing
#         ![png](
#      with
#         ![png](/images/
#      a) If there are any svg images, do likewise-- replace
#             ![svg](
#         with 
#            ![svg](/images/
#  4) If you have a link to an image in the top-level /images folder, in the markdown file, replace
#            ../images
#         with 
#            /images
#  5) Add alt tags to Jupyter images by replacing ![png] or ![svg] with a description, e.g. ![Annotated tree]
