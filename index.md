# Portfolio of my projects

## [Materials- and cheminformatics sampler](https://sampler-flask.herokuapp.com/)
*Uses NumPy, SymPy, ChemPy, Flask, and Bootstrap*

Find a given number of points which satisfy constraints given in an input_file for an n-dimensional space defined on the unit hypercube, then write them to an output file.

Optionally, identify the components (dimensions) in your input (constraints) file using chemical formulas, and sampler will use ChemPy to calculate their molar masses, then output the component weight fraction.

## [Periodic Table Navigator](https://ptablenav.herokuapp.com/)
*Uses Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript*

Understand how the elements are related to each other. Emphasizes electronic configuration of the elements.

## [Price Per Unit Calculator](http://www.whitegloveapps.com/priceper/priceper.html)
*Uses JavaScript*
A utility for shopping: calculate the unit price by weight, count, area, etc.

# My open-source contributions

## SymPy computer algebra system in pure Python
- [Contributed code for documentation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pulls?q=is:pr+author:bertiewooster+is:merged) to explain usage of a core class for users and developers, and improve accessibility
- [Led selection of new Sphinx theme for SymPy documentation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/22716)

## ChemPy package for chemistry in Python
- Initiated and provided scientific and coding direction to issue to [improve interpretation of chemical formulas](https://github.com/bjodah/chempy/issues/202)
- Spurred a developer to code improvement
- Package author wrote “Great work guys!”

## Sphinx documentation generator
- Initiated issue to [improve accessibility and internationalization of documentation generated by Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues?q=author%253Abertiewooster); was addressed within a day by Sphinx’s main developer
