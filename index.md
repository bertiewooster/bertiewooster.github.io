## [Materials- and cheminformatics sampler](sampler-flask.herokuapp.com/)
### Uses NumPy, SymPy, ChemPy, Flask, and Bootstrap
Find a given number (n_results) of points (vectors) which satisfy constraints given in an input_file for an n-dimensional space defined on the unit hypercube, then write them to an output file (output_file). Optionally, identify the components (dimensions) in your input (constraints) file using chemical formulas, and sampler will use ChemPy to calculate their molar masses, then output the component weight fraction.

## [Periodic Table Navigator](ptablenav.herokuapp.com/)
### Uses Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript
Understand how the elements are related to each other. Emphasizes electronic configuration of the elements.

## [Price Per Unit Calculator[(http://www.whitegloveapps.com/priceper/priceper.html)]
