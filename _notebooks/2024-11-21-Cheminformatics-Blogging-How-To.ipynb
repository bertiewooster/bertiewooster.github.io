I sped this up by only traversing each bond once, rather than using each bond as a starting point and then traversing all connected bonds. I also sped up the operation at the dataframe level: Because it contained multiple rows for many chromophores, I cached the result for each chromophore so it wouldn't need to be recalculated.\n",

For example, in many posts, I use Polars in eager mode rather than [lazy mode](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/lazy/) because I want to show the steps along the way, for example the dataframe after the data is initially loaded. If speed was the sole goal, I'd use lazy mode to evaluate only once, to get the final results."
