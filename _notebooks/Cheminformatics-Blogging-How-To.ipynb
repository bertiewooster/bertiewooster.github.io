I sped this up by only traversing each bond once, rather than using each bond as a starting point and then traversing all connected bonds. I also sped up the operation at the dataframe level: Because it contained multiple rows for many chromophores, I cached the result for each chromophore so it wouldn't need to be recalculated.\n",
