    "Often, there's a single cheminformatics operation which takes a significant amount of time on a sizeable dataset. This slow step is worth speeding up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the optical properties post, the slow step was traversing each molecular graph to determine its longest conjugated bond chain. I sped this up by only traversing each bond once, rather than using each bond as a starting point and then traversing all connected bonds. I also sped up the operation at the dataframe level: Because it contained multiple rows for many chromophores, I cached the result for each chromophore so it wouldn't need to be recalculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that speeding up the code is not the only goal: Because the blog post is intended to be educational, there's a balance between code speed and clarity. For example, in many posts, I use Polars in eager mode rather than lazy mode because I want to show the steps along the way, for example the dataframe after the data is initially loaded. If speed was the sole goal, I'd use lazy mode to evaluate only once, to get the final results."
