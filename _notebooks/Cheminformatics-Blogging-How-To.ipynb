I sped this up by only traversing each bond once, rather than using each bond as a starting point and then traversing all connected bonds. I also sped up the operation at the dataframe level: Because it contained multiple rows for many chromophores, I cached the result for each chromophore so it wouldn't need to be recalculated.\n",

If speed was the sole goal, I'd use lazy mode to evaluate only once, to get the final results."
