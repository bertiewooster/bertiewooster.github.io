    "I participated in the [LLM Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science & Chemistry](https://llmhackathon.github.io/) September 11-12, 2025. It was a great opportunity to think and learn about how LLMs can be used in science. It was also a chance to meet new people in the community, or collaborate live with folks I know from online. I was on the [ChemGraph-IR](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ChemGraph) team whose goal was to calculate the infrared absorption spectrum of a molecule given an LLM prompt requesting the IR spectrum. Here are some things I learned about how to get the most done in a hackathon."

    "When a team starts a hackathon, it's natural to focus first on how to start: What permissions to set up, what code to write, etc. But it's actually a good idea to think first about what the deliverables will be. For example, for this hackathon the deliverables were a two-minute video, a submission form, and a social media post announcing the completed project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective way to plan a video is with storyboards, that is the still images that provide the flow of the video. So what I would do next hackathon is start by deciding the key assets--project outputs such as graphs. That would give everyone a good starting point:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The software developers would know what they're working towards, for example a graph of infrared absorption intensity against frequency (cm<sup>-1</sup>).\n",
    "- The video creators would know what the storyboards are so they could plan the video. It would probably have alerted the team to the amount of work that needed to go into the video. At least two of us spent most of the second day working on the video. While our [ChemGraph video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLz4MXTztWA) was perfectly fine--it was like a scientific presentation with slides and narration--other teams' were more elaborate and were projects in themselves. Had someone focused on the presentation from the beginning, they might have come up with an outside-the-box idea."
