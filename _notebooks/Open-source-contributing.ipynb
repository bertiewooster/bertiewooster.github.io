    "**Example:** While working through the [Getting Started with the RDKit in Python](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html), I noted that you had to scroll down about a dozen screens before you saw a picture of a molecule. Molecular structures are one of the most common ways that chemists communicate, so I [contributed a simple example early in the guide of how to draw a molecule](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/pull/5803)."

The RDKit already had a way to draw a series of molecules, [MolsToGridImage](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.Draw.html#rdkit.Chem.Draw.MolsToGridImage), so my contribution was a logical extension of that functionality."
