    "It also confirms what I've found in other ways: Simple ideas make good blog posts. It's easy to think that you have to do something very complex to make a contribution: People have asked me if they need to come up with very advanced ideas for blog posts. But as I've written in [How to Write Cheminformatics Blog Posts]({% post_url 2024-11-21-Cheminformatics-Blogging-How-To %}), coming up with ideas can be as simple as going through a tutorial and building on it. In fact, actually I've found via Google Search Console that my very first blog post, [Find and Highlight the Maximum Common Substructure Between a Set of Molecules Using RDKit]({% post_url 2022-10-09-RDKit-find-and-highlight-the-maximum-common-substructure-between-molecules %}) is the most visited from searches. Presumably this is because many people want to accomplish the simple task of finding a maximum common substructure.\n",
